Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

## My process

### Built with

### Continued development

- Continuing to grow css and html skills and widening different components to use

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This might be my favorite resource to use, being able to see where different components fit.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex) - My other favorite based on the usabliity to test different features depending on what tool you need help with.
